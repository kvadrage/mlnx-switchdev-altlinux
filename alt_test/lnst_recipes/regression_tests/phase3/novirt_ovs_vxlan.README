PerfRepo integration:
    First, preparation in PerfRepo is required - you need to create Test objects
    through the web interface that properly describe the individual Netperf
    tests that this recipe runs. Don't forget to also add appropriate metrics.
    For these Netperf tests it's always:
    * throughput
    * throughput_min
    * throughput_max
    * throughput_deviation

    After that, to enable support for PerfRepo you need to create the file
    novirt_ovs_vxlan.mapping and define the following id mappings:
    tcp_ipv4_id -> to store ipv4 TCP_STREAM Netperf test results, maps to TestUid of a PerfRepo Test object
    tcp_ipv6_id -> to store ipv6 TCP_STREAM Netperf test results, maps to TestUid of a PerfRepo Test object
    udp_ipv4_id -> to store ipv4 UDP_STREAM Netperf test results, maps to TestUid of a PerfRepo Test object
    udp_ipv6_id -> to store ipv4 UDP_STREAM Netperf test results, maps to TestUid of a PerfRepo Test object

    To enable result comparison agains baselines you need to create a Report in
    PerfRepo that will store the baseline. Set up the Report to only contain results
    with the same hash tag and then add a new mapping to the mapping file, with
    this format:
    <some_hash> = <report_id>

    The hash value is automatically generated during test execution and added
    to each result stored in PerfRepo. To get the Report id you need to open
    that report in our browser and find if in the URL.

    When running this recipe you should also define the 'product_name' alias
    (e.g. RHEL7) in order to tag the result object in PerfRepo.
